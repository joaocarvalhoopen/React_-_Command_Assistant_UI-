# React - Command Assistant UI
A simple GUI React project with a command type interface, to enable interaction with a server.

## Description
This is a simple React web project made in Javascript. It gives the initial frame for a command GUI to interact with a Raspberry Pi server. This is only the React part, and is a work in progress. <br>
<br>
The UIX experience is a command and response kind of interactions, with a history scroll of past commands, a history on the command it self, like a shell history and a group of configurable buttons to execute the commands in one go. Or to write the command skeleton in the text box.
